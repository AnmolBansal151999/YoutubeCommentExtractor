# YoutubeCommentExtractor
A youtube comments (top thread) scrapper based on Youtube data API 
This file search for videos based on keywords and publish results in csv format with video ids, titles and comments (top threads).
It uses YouTube Data API v3 for services
I have also added a function to catche API value received on each call to avoid manually adding it each time using pickle library
